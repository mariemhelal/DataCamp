# Analyzing Business Data in SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze customer order data using SQL. The main objectives are:

1. **Segment Users by Order Count**: Categorize users into three groups based on the number of orders they have placed - "Low-orders users", "Mid-orders users", and "High-orders users".
2. **Analyze User Behavior**: Determine the number of distinct users in each order count segment to better understand customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
3. **Inform Business Decisions**: The insights gained from this analysis can be used to make data-driven decisions, such as optimizing marketing strategies, adjusting product offerings, or enhancing the customer experience.

## SQL Analysis
The SQL queries used for this analysis are provided in the `sql_analysis.sql` file. The key steps include:

1. Creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store the count of orders per user.
2. Using a CASE statement to categorize users into the three order count segments.
3. Counting the distinct users in each segment to determine the size of each group.

## Insights and Findings
The analysis revealed the following key insights:

- **Low-orders users**: This group accounts for the largest number of users, indicating there may be opportunities to encourage more frequent purchases from these customers.
- **Mid-orders users**: This segment represents a smaller but potentially more profitable group, as they are already engaging with the business more actively.
- **High-orders users**: This group is the smallest but likely the most valuable, as they are the company's most loyal and engaged customers.

These findings can be used to inform targeted marketing campaigns, product development, and customer retention strategies.

## Usage
To run the SQL analysis, you will need access to a database that contains the necessary order data. Update the `sql_analysis.sql` file with the appropriate table and column names for your data.

Once you have the SQL queries set up, you can integrate the analysis into your business intelligence or reporting workflows.
